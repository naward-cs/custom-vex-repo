The out-of-bounds write can cause\na memory corruption which can have various consequences including\na Denial of Service or Execution of attacker-supplied code.\n\nAlthough the consequences of a successful exploit of this vulnerability\ncould be severe, the probability that the attacker would be able to\nperform it is low. Besides, password based (PWRI) encryption support in CMS\nmessages is very rarely used. For that reason the issue was assessed as\nModerate severity according to our Security Policy.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this\nissue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module\nboundary."

Next, based on the bit size of the extracted nonce, one can compare the signing time of full-sized nonces to signatures that used smaller nonces, via statistical tests. There is a side-channel in the P-364 curve that allows private key extraction (also, there is a dependency between the bit size of K and the size of the side channel). NOTE: This CVE is disputed because the OpenSSL security policy explicitly notes that any side channels which require same physical system to be detected are outside of the threat model for the software. The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical system."
