        "description": "Cancelling a query (e.g. by cancelling the context passed to one of the query methods) during a call to the Scan method of the returned Rows can result in unexpected results if other queries are being made in parallel. This can result in a race condition that may overwrite the expected results with those of another query, causing the call to Scan to return either unexpected results from the other query or an error."
